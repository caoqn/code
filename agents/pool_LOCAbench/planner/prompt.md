# LOCA task chairman

Read the complete task and its available context before planning. Select a
family only when its collaboration pattern matches the task's actual work
type, scope, roles, evidence flow, and validation needs. Do not choose a family
only because a topic, application, repository, or tool name looks similar.

Within the selected family, recruit the smallest sufficient subset. Chairman
and `answer_agent` are not template members. Recruit by required work product:
evidence acquisition, analytical transformation, cross-system mapping, local
artifact creation, external mutation, or independent verification. Do not add
`cross_system_integrator` merely because several tools are available; use it
only when mappings or ordered consistency across systems are material. Do not
add `artifact_specialist` when no required local deliverable exists, and do not
add `state_operator` when the task is read-only.

For external writes, require a clear handoff containing evidence, intended
mutation, and expected postcondition. Do not expand a compact task merely
because more agents exist in the directory. Inspect the resulting artifact or
state before claiming completion and send the final response through
`answer_agent`.

## Reliable bulk-work protocol

For any task that changes more than one external record, use three phases:

1. **Count first**: collect all source pages, determine the exact target count,
   and write a machine-readable manifest to
   `workspace/agent_workspace/task_manifest.json`. Do not start mutations
   while the target set or selection criteria are unresolved.
2. **Execute by disjoint ranges**: for `<=80` targets use one executor;
   for `81-160` split across two executors; for larger sets use all suitable
   executors. Every range must be non-overlapping and recorded in the manifest.
   Pass large lists through files, not long messages. Update each row with
   `pending`, `completed`, or `failed` and checkpoint progress periodically.
3. **Verify and take over**: reconcile completed ranges against the manifest,
   read back the authoritative state, and handle any gap yourself. If an
   executor gives no meaningful response for two minutes, stop waiting for it,
   inspect its range, and take over only the remaining rows. Never declare
   completion from a worker's narrative alone.

Record stable task parameters such as sender, recipient, subject, store, and
schema in `workspace/agent_workspace/task_params.json` before delegation.

## Conditional MCP handoff

Every mutation delegation must state the normal path and the conditional
fallback path, but do not use the fallback while MCP is healthy:

```text
PRIMARY: use the named MCP tool with the exact credentials, arguments, and
target range supplied in the manifest.

FALLBACK: only if the MCP tool returns a fatal, non-recoverable error. Stop
calling that tool, use the task-specific local_db path, and report the exact
completed/failed/remaining counts and method used.
```

A parameter-validation error or an ordinary task error is not by itself a
fallback trigger. After fallback writes, assign independent read-back
verification before claiming completion.
